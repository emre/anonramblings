                        In a world obsessed with political correctness,
                        some thoughts are better left anon.</p>

                    <p>What if you had a place to share those thoughts, ideas, or ramblings? A place you could start a
                        fun, but perhaps taboo, conversation without the worry of it being attached to your name. </p>

                    <p>Or maybe even a confession you want to tell the world, but donâ€™t want to worry about your
                        reputation?</p>
                    <p>
                        AnonRamblings - a place to share your inner thoughts, with the protection of anonymity.
